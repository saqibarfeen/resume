My research interest is to augment human intelligence with the computational and algorithmic tools, for solving the day to day problems of us. E.g our smart-phone allows us to navigate to the destinations in the minimum time. 

I want to carry out Research with Natural Languages Processing [1] to analyze vast amount of knowledge (in the form of books/papers) and recommend/sort books based on personal preferences.

[2] This paper is one of my research interests: To analyze social network graphs and get a personalized recommendation on the number of friends, that minimizes cost (screen time, etc.) with maximizing social life and interests. 

This Residency program offers a chance to do research in AI with the brightest minds.
